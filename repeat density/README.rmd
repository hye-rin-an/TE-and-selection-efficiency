These scripts are used to calculate different densities (CDS, GC and repeat)

1) using RepeatModelor, generate repeat libraries per species: "jm.RepeatModeler.pl"
2) using RepeatMasker, detect and identify repeats using libraries from RepeatModeler: "jm.RepeatMasker.py"

RepeatMasker's outputs are the following files: *.tbl, *.masked and *.out

3) Calculate different densities:
- from *.masked, calculate total repeat density: "totalrepeat.py"
  GC content: "GCcontent.py" 
- from *.out, calculate repeat density by type of repeats: "repeatbyclass.py"
  age distribution of LINE and SINE: "age.distribution.py"
  frequency of different LINE and SINE sub-families: "LINSINE.subfamily.distribution.bywindow.py" and "family.distribution.byspecies.R"
  repeat density of top 5 most abundunt sub-families of LINE and SINE for each species: "top5.LINESINE.py"
- calculating CDS density: "CDSdensity.py"

4) bootstrap confidence intervals: "bootstrap.*.R"
